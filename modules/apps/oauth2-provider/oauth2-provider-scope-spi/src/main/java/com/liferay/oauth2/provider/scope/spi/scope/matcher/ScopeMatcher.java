/**
 * This interface represents the strategy used to match scope. Some of these
 * strategies may be:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>STRICT: only scope matching a particular string or strings
 *     will match</li>
 *     <li>HIERARCHICAL: scope following some naming rules might match more
 *     general scope. Hierarchy can be described for instance using
 *     <i>dot notation</i>. In such scenario <i>everything</i> can also imply
 *     longer scope such as <i>everything.readonly</i>.
 *    </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * ScopeMatcher is used together with
 * {@link com.liferay.oauth2.provider.scope.spi.prefixhandler.PrefixHandler}
 * and {@link com.liferay.oauth2.provider.scope.spi.scopemapper.ScopeMapper}
 * to tailor the matching strategy to the framework configuration.
